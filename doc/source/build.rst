Python
^^^^^^

Python 2.7 is required in order to properly run Thug. You may be lucky running it with
Python 2.6 but please consider that it is not supported so issues related to Python 2.6
will be simply ignored. Python source code can be downloaded at http://www.python.org.


Google V8/PyV8
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  
Google V8 is Google's open source JavaScript engine. V8 is written in C++ and is used
in Google Chrome, the open source browser from Google. V8 implements ECMAScript as 
specified in ECMA-262, 3rd edition, and runs on Windows XP and Vista, Mac OS X 10.5 
(Leopard), and Linux systems that use IA-32 or ARM processors. V8 can run standalone, 
or can be embedded into any C++ application.  

PyV8 is a Python wrapper for the Google V8 engine. PyV8 acts as a bridge between the 
Python and JavaScript objects and supports the Google V8 engine in Python scripts.

In order to properly install Google V8 and PyV8 please follow the procedure described 
below.

1. Checkout V8 source code from SVN

.. code-block:: sh

        $ svn checkout http://v8.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ v8

2. Checkout PyV8 source code from SVN

.. code-block:: sh

        $ svn checkout http://pyv8.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pyv8

4. Move to PyV8 source code directory

.. code-block:: sh

        $ cd pyv8

5. Build and install (PyV8 setup.py will properly install both V8
   and PyV8)
