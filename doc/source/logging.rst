Logging
*******

Currently different logging modes are available in Thug. Some of them can be combined
in order to store the result of the analysis in different formats if needed. By default
Thug attempts storing analysis logs in a MongoDB instance (see later for a detailed
explanation of the MongoDB collection schema).

**BEWARE**: if a MongoDB instance is not available and no other logging mode is selected
Thug will not store any analysis log.

The available logging modes are:

* MongoDB logging mode (enabled by default)
* HPFeeds logging mode (enabled by default)
* JSON logging mode
* MAEC 1.1 logging mode
* File logging mode


Logging configuration
=====================

The configuration file *Logging/logging.conf* defines the way Thug uses to log the results 
of its analyses. The default logging.conf file is shown below. 

.. code-block:: sh

    [hpfeeds]
    enable:     True
    host:       hpfeeds.honeycloud.net
    port:       10000
    ident:      q6jyo@hp1
    secret:     edymvouqpfe1ivud

    [mongodb]
    enable:     True
    host:       localhost
    port:       27017

The different sections of the configuration files will be explained later in this 
document.

MongoDB logging mode
====================

By default Thug attempts storing the result of its analyses in a MongoDB instance. Be
aware that if you don't install MongoDB and pymongo (the Python wrapper) or if the 
MongoDB process is not running, Thug will just emit a warning message and then continue 
its analysis silently not storing the results. This could be exactly what you want but 
please consider that if you do not enable any other logging mode you will end up with 
no logs at all so bear it in mind.

The configuration file *Logging/logging.conf* defines the MongoDB instance configuration
parameters

.. code-block:: sh

    [mongodb]
    enable:     True
    host:       localhost
    port:       27017

The parameters should be quite intuitive to understand. By the way if you install 
MongoDB on the same host you are supposed to run Thug you should not need changing
anything in the default configuration.

If you want Thug to store its results to a different MongoDB instance than that defined
in your *Logging/logging.conf* file, you can specify a different address at runtime, for
example by using the *--mongodb-address* option from the command line. This can be especially
useful when using the dockerized version of Thug, where storing results in Docker itself would
mean to loose them as soon as the Docker instance is shut down.


Collection schema
-----------------

urls
^^^^

The collection *urls* is used to keep track of the URLs visited during the analysis.
A URL is always associated a single entry in this collection even if it is visited 
multiple times (during the same analysis or in different analyses). Associating a 
unique ObjectID to a given URL allows to easily spot interesting scenarios like 
different redirection chains ending up using the same URLs. 

.. code-block:: sh

        { 
            "url" : URL
        }

analyses
^^^^^^^^

The collection *analyses* is used to keep track of the Thug analyses. The analysis
options used for the single analysis are stored together with other useful information 
like the used Thug version and the analysis datetime. Moreover the URL ObjectID of the 
initial URL is stored for convenience.

.. code-block:: sh


        { 
            "url_id"      : Initial URL url_id
            "timestamp"   : Analysis datetime
            "thug"        : {
                                "version"            : Thug version
                                "personality" : { 
                                    "useragent"      : User Agent
                                },
                                "plugins" : { 
                                    "acropdf"        : Acrobat Reader version (if any)
                                    "javaplugin"     : JavaPlugin version (if any)
                                    "shockwaveflash" : Shockwave Flash version (if any)
                                },
                                "options" : { 
                                    "local"          : Local analysis
                                    "nofetch"        : Local no-fetch analysis
                                    "proxy"          : Proxy (if any)
                                    "events"         : Additional DOM events to be processed
                                    "delay"          : Maximum setTimeout/setInterval delay value (in milliseconds)
                                    "referer"        : Referer
                                    "timeout"        : Analysis timeout
                                    "threshold"      : Maximum pages to fetch
                                    "extensive"      : Extensive fetch of linked pages
                                },
                            }
        }

connections
^^^^^^^^^^^

The collection *connections* is used to keep track of the redirections which could happen
during the single analysis. The field *chain_id* is a counter which is incremented by one at 
every redirection and it's meant to be used in order to rebuild the redirection chain in the 
right order while analyzing data.

.. code-block:: sh

        { 
            "analysis_id"    : Analysis ID
            "chain_id"       : Chain ID
            "source_id"      : Source URL url_id
            "destination_id" : Destination URL url_id
            "method"         : Method
            "flags"          : Flags
        }

locations
^^^^^^^^^

The collection *locations* is used to keep track of the content stored at each URL visited
during the analysis. The content is stored in a MongoDB GridFS and additional metadata are 
saved like MD5 and SHA-256 checksums, content size, content type (as served by the server)
and evaluated content type.

.. code-block:: sh


        { 
            "analysis_id"   : Analysis ID
            "url_id"        : URL url_id
            "content_id"    : Content ID (content stored in the GridFS fs)
            "content-type"  : Content Type
            "md5"           : MD5 checksum
            "sha256"        : SHA-256 checksum
            "flags"         : Flags
            "size"          : Data size
            "mime-type"     : Evaluated content type
        }

samples
^^^^^^^

The collection *samples* is used to keep track of the downloaded samples (currently supported 
types: PE, PDF, JAR and SWF). The sample itself is stored in a MongoDB GridFS and additional 
metadata are saved like MD5 and SHA-1 checksums, sample type and imphash (if the sample type 
is PE).

.. code-block:: sh

        { 
            "analysis_id"   : Analysis ID
            "url_id"        : URL url_id
            "sample_id"     : Sample ID (sample stored in the GridFS fs)
            "type"          : Sample type
            "md5"           : MD5 checksum
            "sha1"          : SHA-1 checksum
            "imphash"       : Imphash (if type is PE)
        }

exploits
^^^^^^^^

            'url_id'      : URL url_id
            'module'      : Module/ActiveX Control, etc. that gets exploited
            'description' : Description of the exploit
            'cve'         : CVE number (if available)
            'data'        : Additional information

            "report"        : Analysis report (JSON)
    }


HPFeeds logging mode
====================

HPFeeds is the Honeynet Project central logging feature.

HPFeeds is a lightweight authenticated publish-subscribe protocol that supports arbitrary 
binary payloads. HPFeeds was designed as a simple wire-format so that everyone is able to 
subscribe to the feeds with his favorite language in almost no time.

Different feeds are separated by channels and support arbitrary binary payloads. This means 
that the channel users have to decide about the structure of data. This could for example 
be done by choosing a serialization format.

Access to channels is given to so-called Authkeys which essentially are pairs of an identifier 
and a secret. The secret is sent to the server by hashing it together with a per-connection 
nonce. This way no eavesdroppers can obtain valid credentials. Optionally the protocol can 
be run on top of SSL/TLS, of course.

HPFeeds logging mode is enabled by default and its configuration is saved in the *Logging/logging.conf* 
file

.. code-block:: sh

    [hpfeeds]
    enable:     True
    host:       hpfeeds.honeycloud.net
    port:       10000
    ident:      q6jyo@hp1
    secret:     edymvouqpfe1ivud

If you don't want to report your events and samples, you can turn off HPFeeds by modifying 
the *enable* parameter to *False*. Do not change the other configuration parameters unless 
you know exactly what you are doing. 

Currently Thug shares data in two channels:

- thug.events channel (URL analysis results published in MAEC 1.1 format)
- thug.files channel (downloaded samples)

If you are interested in the data collected by Thug instances, please contact me.

JSON logging mode
=================

The JSON logging mode allows to store both the analysis results and each resource
downloaded during the analysis in JSON format. The JSON logging mode was enabled by default
before Thug 0.5.6 together with the File logging mode. After that version you have to 
explicitely enable it through the option *-Z* (or *--json-logging*). Please consider that 
the JSON log is stored in the MongoDB instance (if available). See the *MongoDB logging 
mode* for details. If the File logging format is enabled too, the JSON log will be stored
in a JSON file in the log directory too. The JSON format is shown below.

.. code-block:: sh

    {
        "url"         : Initial URL
        "timestamp"   : Analysis datetime
        "logtype"     : "json-log",

MAEC 1.1 logging mode
=====================

Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization (MAEC) is a structured language for 
encoding and communicating high fidelity information about any type of malware based upon 
attributes such as behaviors, artifacts, and attack patterns. As a language, MAEC offers 
a grammar and vocabulary that provide a standard means of communicating information about 
malware attributes. MAEC is designed and maintaned by MITRE. 

Thug currently supports MAEC version 1.1 and you should enable the *-M* (or *--maec11-logging*) 
option in order to locally store the analysis results in such format. 

If the MAEC 1.1 logging mode is enabled, Thug will attempt to store analysis results in a 
MongoDB instance, if available. 

If the MAEC 1.1 logging mode and the File logging mode are enabled, Thug will attempt to 
store analysis results in a MongoDB instance, if available, and in a XML file in the log
directory.

Please note that not enabling MAEC 1.1 logging mode does not affect HPFeeds logging mode 
proper operations so even if this mode is not enabled analysis results will be published in 
MAEC 1.1 format on the *thug.events* channel.

Further documentation about the MAEC 1.1 language can be found at http://maec.mitre.org/language/version1.1/


File logging mode
=================

The File logging mode allows to store both the analysis results and each resource
downloaded during the analysis in flat files. The File logging mode was enabled by default 
before Thug 0.5.6. After that version you have to explicitely enable it through the option
*-F* (or *--file-logging*). Please consider that all the information stored in flat files
are stored in the MongoDB instance (if available). This option could be convenient in some
situations but if you plan to analyze a huge number of URLs per day probably thinking 
about storing results and resources in a database is better than spread such data on your
hard disk. 

If you enable the File logging mode the directory which contains the logs for the session
will appear as shown below

In this eaxample the MAEC 1.1 logging mode is enabled and the file *analysis.xml* contains the 
URL analysis results saved in MAEC 1.1 format. Please note that all the resources downloaded 
during the URL analysis are saved in the log directory based on their Content-Type for 
convenience. Moreover if MongoDB is installed the information you can see in this directory 
are saved in the database instance too.
