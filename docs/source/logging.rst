Logging
*******

Currently different logging modes are available in Thug. Some of them can be combined
in order to store the result of the analysis in different formats if needed. By default
Thug attempts storing analysis logs in a MongoDB instance (see later for a detailed
explanation of the MongoDB collection schema).

The available logging modes are:

* MongoDB logging mode
* ElasticSearch
* JSON logging mode
* File logging mode


Logging configuration
=====================

The configuration file *thug.conf* defines the way Thug uses to log the results of its
analyses. The default logging configuration is shown below.

.. code-block:: sh

    [mongodb]
    enable:     false
    host:       localhost
    port:       27017

    [elasticsearch]
    enable:     false
    url:        http://192.168.56.101:9200
    index:      thug


The different sections of the configuration files will be explained later in this
document.

MongoDB logging mode
====================

By default Thug attempts storing the result of its analyses in a MongoDB instance. Be
aware that if you don't install MongoDB and pymongo (the Python wrapper) or if the
MongoDB process is not running, Thug will just emit a warning message and then continue
its analysis silently not storing the results. This could be exactly what you want but
please consider that if you do not enable any other logging mode you will end up with
no logs at all so bear it in mind.

The configuration file *thug.conf* defines the MongoDB instance configuration
parameters

.. code-block:: sh

    [mongodb]
    enable:     True
    host:       localhost
    port:       27017

The parameters should be quite intuitive to understand. By the way if you install
MongoDB on the same host you are supposed to run Thug you should not need changing
anything in the default configuration.

If you want Thug to store its results to a different MongoDB instance than that defined
in your *thug.conf* file, you can specify a different address at runtime, for example by
using the *--mongodb-address* option from the command line. This can be especially useful
when using the dockerized version of Thug, where storing results in Docker itself would
mean to lose them as soon as the Docker instance is shut down.


Collection schema
-----------------

analyses
^^^^^^^^

The collection *analyses* is used to keep track of the Thug analyses. The analysis
options used for the single analysis are stored together with other useful information
like the used Thug version and the analysis datetime. Moreover the URL ObjectID of the
initial URL is stored for convenience.

.. code-block:: sh


        {
            "url_id"      : Initial URL url_id
            "timestamp"   : Analysis datetime
            "thug"        : {
                                "version"            : Thug version

                                    "timeout"        : Analysis timeout
                                    "threshold"      : Maximum pages to fetch
                                    "extensive"      : Extensive fetch of linked pages
                                },
                            }
        }

        }

connections
^^^^^^^^^^^

The collection *connections* is used to keep track of the redirections which could happen
during the single analysis. The field *chain_id* is a counter which is incremented by one at
every redirection and it's meant to be used in order to rebuild the redirection chain in the
right order while analyzing data.

.. code-block:: sh

            "report"        : Analysis report (JSON)
    }

locations
^^^^^^^^^

The collection *locations* is used to keep track of the content stored at each URL visited
during the analysis. The content is stored in a MongoDB GridFS and additional metadata are
saved like MD5 and SHA-256 checksums, content size, content type (as served by the server)
and evaluated content type.

.. code-block:: sh


        {
            "analysis_id"   : Analysis ID
            "url_id"        : URL url_id
            "status"        : HTTP status code

            "sha256"        : SHA-256 checksum
            "ssdeep"        : Ssdeep hash
            "flags"         : Flags
            "size"          : Data size
            "mime-type"     : Evaluated content type
        }

samples
^^^^^^^

The collection *samples* is used to keep track of the downloaded samples (currently supported
types: PE, PDF, JAR and SWF). The sample itself is stored in a MongoDB GridFS and additional
metadata are saved like MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256 checksums, sample type and imphash (if the sample
type is PE).

.. code-block:: sh

        {
            "analysis_id"   : Analysis ID
            "url_id"        : URL url_id
            "sample_id"     : Sample ID (sample stored in the GridFS fs)
            "type"          : Sample type
            "md5"           : MD5 checksum
            "sha1"          : SHA-1 checksum
            "sha256"        : SHA-256 checksum
            "imphash"       : Imphash (if type is PE)
        }

screenshots
^^^^^^^^^^^

The collection *screenshots* is used to store base-64 encoded screenshots (PDF format)
of the analyzed page.

.. code-block:: sh

   {
            "analysis_id"   : Analysis ID
            "url_id"        : URL url_id
            "screenshot"    : URL screenshot
    }

urls
^^^^

The collection *urls* is used to keep track of the URLs visited during the analysis.
A URL is always associated a single entry in this collection even if it is visited
multiple times (during the same analysis or in different analyses). Associating a
unique ObjectID to a given URL allows to easily spot interesting scenarios like
different redirection chains ending up using the same URLs.

.. code-block:: sh

        {
            "url" : URL
        }


ElasticSearch logging module
============================

The ElasticSearch logging mode allows to store both the analysis results and each resource
downloaded during the analysis in an ElasticSearch instance. Deploying and configuring the
instance is totally up to you and no images are provided for that.

Starting from Thug version 1.6 you are required to install Python ElasticSearch Client by
yourself. The reason behind this choice is that you could be interested in installing a
specific library version based on the ElasticSearch version you are using. Please look at
`Python ElasticSearch Client documentation <https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_
for additional details.

ElasticSearch logging mode is not enabled by default and you need to enable the option -G
(--elasticsearch-logging). The ElasticSearch configuration is saved in the *thug.conf*
file. Be sure of defining the right URL for connecting to your instance. You may want to
change the index name where data will be stored but this is not really necessary in the most
common situations.

.. code-block:: sh

    [elasticsearch]
    enable:     True
    url:        http://192.168.56.101:9200
    index:      thug


JSON logging mode
=================

The JSON logging mode allows to store both the analysis results and each resource
downloaded during the analysis in JSON format. The JSON logging mode was enabled by default
before Thug 0.5.6 together with the File logging mode. If you are using Thug 0.5.7 (or later)
you have to explicitely enable it through the option *-Z* (or *--json-logging*). Please consider
that the JSON log is stored in the MongoDB instance (if available). See the *MongoDB logging
mode* for details. If the File logging format is enabled too, the JSON log will be stored
in a JSON file in the log directory too. The JSON format is shown below.

.. code-block:: sh

    {
        "url"         : Initial URL
        "timestamp"   : Analysis datetime
        "logtype"     : "json-log",
        "thug"        : {
                            "version"            : Thug version

                                    "useragent"      : User Agent
                            },
                            "plugins" : {
                                    "acropdf"        : Acrobat Reader version (if any)

                                    "shockwaveflash" : Shockwave Flash version (if any)
                            },
                            "options" : {
                                    "local"          : Local analysis
                                    "nofetch"        : Local no-fetch analysis
                                    "proxy"          : Proxy (if any)
                                    "events"         : Additional DOM events to be processed
                                    "delay"          : Maximum setTimeout/setInterval delay value (in milliseconds)
                                    "referer"        : Referer
                                    "timeout"        : Analysis timeout
                                    "threshold"      : Maximum pages to fetch
                                    "extensive"      : Extensive fetch of linked pages
                            },
        "awis"        : [],
        "behavior"    : [],
        "classifiers" : [],
        "code"        : [],
        "connections" : [],
        "exploits"    : [],
        "favicons"    : [],
        "files"       : [],

        }



File logging mode
=================

The File logging mode allows to store both the analysis results and each resource
downloaded during the analysis in flat files. The File logging mode was enabled by default
before Thug 0.5.6. If you are using Thug 0.5.7 (or later) you have to explicitely enable
it through the option *-F* (or *--file-logging*). Please consider that all the information
stored in flat files are stored in the MongoDB instance (if available). This option could
be convenient in some situations but if you plan to analyze a huge number of URLs per day
probably thinking about storing results and resources in a database is better than spread
such data on your hard drive.

If you enable the File logging mode the directory which contains the logs for the session
will appear as shown below

In this example the MAEC 1.1 logging mode is enabled and the file *analysis.xml* contains the
URL analysis results saved in MAEC 1.1 format (MAEC 1.1 logging is no longer supported). Please
notice that all the resources downloaded during the URL analysis are saved in the log directory
based on their Content-Type for convenience. Moreover if MongoDB is installed the information
you can see in this directory are saved in the database instance as well.
