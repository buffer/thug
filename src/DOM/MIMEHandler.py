    """
        MIMEHandler class is meant to allow registering MIME handlers the 
        same way a real browser would do. 
        
        The default handling for almost all Content-Types is to not further 
        processing the downloaded content and this can be done by returning 
        True from the Content-Type handler. The method `passthrough' is the 
        default handler associated to almost all Content-Types with the few 
        exceptions defined in the method `register_empty_handlers'. 

        Two ways actually exist for further processing a downloaded content. 
        The first one is returning False from the the Content-Type handler.
        The second one is having a None Content-Type handler which turns to 
        be quite useful when an unknown Content-Type is served. In such case 
        the __missing__ method will return None (thus enabling further content
        processing) and log the unknown Content-Type for convenience.
        
        This design is quite flexible because i.e. you can decide to instantiate 
        your own PDF analysis system really quickly by simply defining a new 
        application/pdf Content-Type handler.
