The number of client-side attacks has grown significantly in the past few years
shifting focus on poorly protected vulnerable clients. Just as the most known
honeypot technologies enable research into server-side attacks, honeyclients
allow the study of client-side attacks.

A complement to honeypots, a honeyclient is a tool designed to mimic the behavior
of a user-driven network client application, such as a web browser, and be
exploited by an attacker's content.

Thug is a Python low-interaction honeyclient aimed at mimicing the behavior of a
web browser in order to detect and emulate malicious contents.
