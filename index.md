The number of client-side attacks has grown significantly in the past few years shifting
focus on poorly protected vulnerable clients. Just as the most known honeypot technologies
enable research into server-side attacks, honeyclients allow the study of client-side
attacks. A complement to honeypots, a honeyclient is a tool designed to mimic the behavior
of a user-driven network client application, such as a web browser, and be exploited by an
attacker’s content.
