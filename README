Thug
====

The number of client-side attacks has grown significantly in the past 
few years shifting focus on poorly protected vulnerable clients. Just 
as the most known honeypot technologies enable research into server-side 
attacks, honeyclients allow the study of client-side attacks. 

A complement to honeypots, a honeyclient is a tool designed to mimic 
the behavior of a user-driven network client application, such as a web 
browser, and be exploited by an attacker’s content.

Thug is a Python low-interaction honeyclient aimed at mimicing the 
behavior of a web browser in order to detect and emulate malicious 
contents.

Installation
============

- BeautifulSoup 4

Currently the best way to install Beautiful Soup 4 is through `easy_install'
because it is still in beta release. Beautiful Soup 4 is published through 
PyPi, so you can install it with easy_install or pip. The package name is 
beautifulsoup4, and the same package works on Python 2 and Python 3.

	# easy_install beautifulsoup4  

or alternatively

	# pip install beautifulsoup4
 

- V8/PyV8

In order to properly install V8 and PyV8 please follow the procedure
described below.


1. Checkout V8 source code from SVN  

	$ svn checkout http://v8.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ v8

2. Patch V8 source code with the patches you can find in thug/patches
   directory

	$ cp thug/patches/V8-patch* .
	$ patch -p0 < V8-patch1.diff 
	patching file v8/src/log.h
	$ patch -p0 < V8-patch2.diff 
	patching file v8/src/parser.h
	Hunk #1 succeeded at 456 (offset 7 lines).

3. Checkout PyV8 source code from SVN

	$ svn checkout http://pyv8.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pyv8

4. Set the environment variable V8_HOME with the V8 source code 
   absolute path (you need to change the value reported below)

	$ export V8_HOME=/home/buffer/v8

5. Move to PyV8 source code directory

	$ cd pyv8

6. Build and install (PyV8 setup.py will properly install both V8
   and PyV8)

	~/pyv8 $ python setup.py build
	~/pyv8 $ sudo python setup.py install

7. Test the installation

	~/pyv8 $ python PyV8.py

   If no problems occur, you have successfully installed V8 and PyV8.


In order to install the other required libraries and packages please 
follow installation procedures as specified in their documentation.
